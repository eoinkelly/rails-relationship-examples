# Modelling relationships between database entities


```
QUESTION: in what cases do you need to specify inverse_of in rails association? in what instances is it a good idea?

> Automatic inverse detection only works on has_many, has_one, and belongs_to associations.
> :foreign_key and :through options on the associations, or a custom scope, will also prevent the association's inverse from being found automatically.
> The automatic guessing of the inverse association uses a heuristic based on the name of the class, so it may not work for all associations, especially the ones with non-standard names.
> You can turn off the automatic detection of inverse associations by setting the :inverse_of option to false

contraticts the advice in gitlab style guide

This is all still WIP

TODO List

* Demo polymporhic assoications. They aren't a new kind but they are diff in Rails e.g. prob need a dependent: option
* explain avoiding dependent: options by default thoughtout

=========================
    the db can do deletions or rails can
    every foreign key should define an ON DELETE clause
    When adding a foreign key in PostgreSQL the column is not indexed automatically, thus you must also add a concurrent index. Not doing so will result in cascading deletes being very slow.

> Donâ€™t define options such as dependent: :destroy or dependent: :delete when defining an association. Defining these options means Rails will handle the removal of data, instead of letting the database handle this in the most efficient way possible

The dependent option implements itself with callbacks I presume
I think it might still be required for polymorphic associations
=========================

This repo is my attempt to clarify some best practices for myself around:

1. Clear thinking and clear communicating around data modelling
2. Implementing those models in Rails in the best way possible

## Clear thinking and communicating

> The Biggest Problem in Communication Is the Illusion That It Has Taken Place

We often discuss database schemas, draw them on on whiteboards etc.

Common terms in discussion I have heard and used are  _"has many"_, _"has one"_ etc.
In drawings we often use

* An warrow with filled in head to indicate "many"
* line with `1` or `*` at either end
* line with nothing at one end and `*` at the other

Rails vocabulary for expressing relationships includes phrases like `has_one`, `has_many` etc.

I think should avoid these phrases and notations because they are ambiguous. They are ambiguous because:

1. they don't tell you what should happen in the "zero case" e.g. does _"A has one B"_ mean "A has exactly one B" or _"A usually has one B but might have none"_.
1. Coming from a developer background, we are a bit primed to think of `*` as meaning _0 to many_ because that is how it reads in a regular expression but not everybody involved in data modelling is a developer. It seems common in data modelling for it to mean
 _"one to many"_.

Fuzzy terms can be _ok_ if we already have knowledge of the domain e.g. if the diagram has _posts_ and _authors_ then we already know some things about how that should behave in the real world.

However we aren't always working with a domain that we understand. If, for example, the diagram is about something more abstract like _A_ and _B_ then we have to rely solely on what's in the diagram rather than expertise we already have on the domain.

### Confusion around what "relationship" actually means

When we talk about "relationships" in data modelling, we usually referring to a pair of relationships.

Every relationship has an "inverse relationship" which goes in the opposite direction.
This "relationship pair" is often called a _bidirectional relationship_. Don't let the singular fool you, a bidirectional relationship is actually two single direction relationships.

Relationships are _"bidirectional"_.
Our language and diagrams should reflect this.

Relationships always appear in pairs. We call the pair a bidirectional relationship.

Instead of saying:

> What is the relationship between Author and Post?

we should probably say something like:

> There are a pair of relationships between Author and Post. What are they?

When we draw how entities are connected we know we are actually drawing **a pair** of relationships.

My (crude) diagrams below attempt to capture this. You can read them as follows:

    [A]{r1}----------------{r2}[B]

as

    {distant-entity} has {relationship} {close-entity}
    A has r2 B
    B has r1 A


    TODO: research what UML says here and decide whether it's more useful than my informal stuff

## How many possible kinds of relationship?

Consider a single directed relationship from entity A to entity B. There are 4 possible kinds of single direction relationship:

1. A has at most one B (notated as `0..1`)
1. A has exactly one B (notated as `1`)
1. A has at least one B (notated as `1..N`)
1. A has 0 to many B (notated as `0..N`)

There are 4 cases. There are also 4 cases in the reverse direction from B to A. This means there are 16 possible kinds of bidirectional relationship.

These are the 16 possible bidirectional relationships:

    1.  [A]{0..1}------{0..1}[B]
    2.  [A]{1}---------{0..1}[B]
    3.  [A]{1..N}------{0..1}[B]
    4.  [A]{0..N}------{0..1}[B]
    5.  [A]{0..1}---------{1}[B] (flip of 2.)
    6.  [A]{1}------------{1}[B]
    7.  [A]{1..N}---------{1}[B]
    8.  [A]{0..N}---------{1}[B]
    9.  [A]{0..1}------{1..N}[B] (flip of 3.)
    10. [A]{1}---------{1..N}[B] (flip of 7.)
    11. [A]{1..N}------{1..N}[B]
    12. [A]{0..N}------{1..N}[B]
    13. [A]{0..1}------{0..N}[B] (flip of 4.)
    14. [A]{1}---------{0..N}[B] (flip of 8.)
    15. [A]{1..N}------{0..N}[B] (flip of 12.)
    16. [A]{0..N}------{0..N}[B]

Of the 16 possible combinations, there are only 10 unique combinations if we remove relationships which differ only in their direction.

These are the 10 unique kinds of bidirectional relationship possible:

    1.  [A]{0..1}------{0..1}[B]
    2.  [A]{1}---------{0..1}[B]
    3.  [A]{1..N}------{0..1}[B]
    4.  [A]{0..N}------{0..1}[B]
    5.  [A]{1}------------{1}[B]
    6.  [A]{1..N}---------{1}[B]
    7.  [A]{0..N}---------{1}[B]
    8.  [A]{1..N}------{1..N}[B]
    9.  [A]{0..N}------{1..N}[B]
    10. [A]{0..N}------{0..N}[B]

So, whether we knew it before now or not, these 10 relationships are the toolbox we use to create data models. There are only 10 possible kinds of bidirectional relationship so all the schemas we discuss, diagram and build will be some combination of these.

Next we should look at how to implement these in Rails.

## Modelling the 10 kinds of relationship in Rails

1.  `{0..1} to {0..1}`
2.  `{1}    to {0..1}`
3.  `{1..N} to {0..1}`
4.  `{0..N} to {0..1}`
5.  `{1}    to {1}`
6.  `{1..N} to {1}`
7.  `{0..N} to {1}`
8.  `{1..N} to {1..N}`
9.  `{0..N} to {1..N}`
10. `{0..N} to {0..N}`

Rails implements relationships with a mixture of the following tools:

1. Relationship macros e.g. `belongs_to`, `has_one` etc. and the options you pass to them
1. Model validations
1. Database constraints created in migrations

We consider Rails validations as "advisory" rather than "enforcing" because they can be skipped e.g. `my_model.save(validate: false)`.  Therefore the best outcome for implementing a relationship will use **both** Rails validations (whether explicitly added by `validates` or implicitly added by the relationship macros) **and** Database constraints.

It isn't always possible to achieve this outcome. And sometimes, while the outcome is possible, there are trade-offs which make us choose not to.

    TODO: back ^^^ up with some data

Your decision tree when implementing a relationship in Rails should be:

1. Choose the most appropriate one of the 10 bidirectional relationships
2. Decide on deletion behaviour
    * This is nto always required ?
    * TODO: list which ones it is required


    IDEA: a decision tree diagram

    IDEA: a table summarising all 10 relationships with the following cols
      relationship-name
      LHS rails macro
      RHS rails macro
      database migration details
      deletion behaviour options
      ??? others

#### Explicit inverse_of

Rails will attempt to automatically guess the inverse relationship in many cases. This automatic detection fails if

* You use a `foreign_key: ` option on the association
* You add a custom scope to the association
* You use the `through:` option on the association
* The class names do not line up such that Rails can guess the class name

Because of the large number of cases where automatic inverse guessing does not work, we think it is easier to always add an explicit `inverse_of` so that you don't have to remember those edge cases. All the examples below specify an explicit `:inverse_of` option.

However a team may choose to rely on Rails' automatic `inverse_of` guessing without harming the quality of the implementation, provided the whole team understands the exceptions above and adds explicit `inverse_of` options where required.

#### Important points to take away (common to all the implementations below):

* Rails does not create foreign key constraints by default in migrations.
    * These constraints are very important for maintaining data integrity so we need to add the `foreign_key: true` option whenever possible.
* Always add an index to the foreign key column
    * because it makes cascading deletes acceptably fast (Not 100% on this one yet)
    * TODO: does rails create it implicitly???
    * Do we care about the index if we don't have cascading deletes???
* Rails use of synthetic id columns for primary keys is a good thing and avoids a lot of problems
    * It avoids potentially expensive `ON UPDATE` options in our foreign key constraints.
* Some relationships have more than one possible deletion behaviour.

### 1. {0..1} to {0..1}

Consider the following relationship:

    Alfa {0..1} to {0..1} Bravo

which reads as:

    Alfa has 0..1 Bravo
    Bravo has 0..1 Alfa

Rails implements this using a combination of the `belongs_to` and `has_one` macros.

It does not matter in which model we put the `belongs_to` (it does matter for some relationships) so in our example we arbitrarily put `belongs_to` in `Alfa` and `has_one` in `Bravo`.

Things to watch out for:

* Rails does not create foreign key constraints by default in migrations. These constraints are very important for maintaining data integrity so we need to add the `foreign_key: true` option in the migration.
* Rails will validate a `belongs_to` relationship by default so we need to add the `optional: true` option to make the relationship a `0..1`
* Rails will not validate a `has_one` relationship by default.

Deletion behaviour

* Both sides of the relationship can be 0 i.e. the relationship is optional in both directions. This means that deleting the model on either side of the relationship should not delete the other model. Instead it should nullify the relationship.

#### Example code

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE app/models/alfa.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE app/models/bravo.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE db/migrate/20210704022223_connect_alfa_and_bravo.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE spec/models/alfa_bravo_relationship_spec.rb
```

| Recommended                                 | :white_check_mark: |

### 2. {0..1} to {1}

Consider the following relationship:

    Charlie {0..1} to {1} Deltum

which reads as:

    Charlie has exactly 1 Deltum
    Deltum has 0..1 Charlie

Rails implements this bidirectional relationship a combination of the `belongs_to` and `has_one` macros. Does it matter which model we put the `belongs_to` in? Yes.

The model with the `belongs_to` macro will have an extra column added to its database table. That column contains the id of the related record in the other table.

We can then create a database constraint (remember, those are the "enforcing" kind) which says that the new column cannot be empty. This effectively requires that the relationship exist and the database will refuse to save a record which violates this rule.

However, the other database table has no extra column so we have nothing to apply a database constraint to. It is _technically_ possible to create such a constraint with a database trigger but it's not common to do so.

The bottom line is that if we want to enforce a `{0..1} to {1}` relationship at the database layer, we must put the new column (the foreign key) in the table which has the `{1}` half of the bidirectional relationship. Hence, we must put the `belongs_to` in the model that is the `{1}`

Another way of thinking about this is that `belongs_to` can create a `{1}` backed by database constraints but `has_one` cannot.

#### Deletions

The bidirectional relationship

    Charlie {0..1} to {1} Deltum

does not, on its own, tell you how deletions should be handled. You need to choose that as part of your implementation.

For example, when you attempt to delete a Deltum which has an associated Charlie, then that Charlie will be in an forbidden state i.e. the Charlie will exist without a Deltum.

There are 2 options:

1. Fail the attempt to delete the Deltum with an error.
    * This allows the application to decide how to handle the error e.g. it might assign the associated Charlie a new Deltum before attempting to delete the Deltum again or it might signal the error to the user or logs.
    * This is the default behaviour when the `on_delete` option is not specified in the migration
    * This is also the option we use in the code example below.
2. Automatically Delete the associated Charlie when the Deltum is deleted
    * This _may_ be appropriate for your data model. It is very easy to opt-in to automatic deletion with Rails. See the comments in the migration file below for details on how to enable this automatic deletion.

#### Example code

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE app/models/charlie.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE app/models/deltum.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE db/migrate/20210705071426_connect_charlie_and_deltum.rb
```

```ruby
INCLUDE_FILE spec/models/charlie_deltum_relationship_spec.rb
```

| Recommended                                 | :white_check_mark: |

### 3. {1..N} to {0..1}

Rails implements this bidirectional relationship a combination of the `belongs_to` and `has_many` macros.

Things to watch out for:

* You must set `belongs_to(..., optional: true)` to make that side of the relationship `{0..1}`.
* You must set `null: true` in the migration to match the `belongs_to(..., optional: true)` model.
* Rails has no `has_many(..., required: true)` to make that side of the relationship `{1..N}` so we use a presence validation. Note this does not add any database enforcement of the relationship.

### 4. {0..N} to {0..1}

This is a standard Rails has_many...belongs_to

Summary of changes by layer:

* Relationship macro layer
* Validation layer
* Migration layer

Example:

```ruby
# app/models/captain.rb
class Captain < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :starship,
    inverse_of: :captains,
    optional: true, # needed for the 0.. bit
    dependent: nil # nil(default)|destroy|destroy_async|delete|nullify|restrict_with_exception|restrict_with_error
end

# app/models/starship.rb
class Starship < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :captains,
    inverse_of: :starships,
    dependent: nil # nil(default)|destroy|destroy_async|delete|nullify|restrict_with_exception|restrict_with_error
end

# db/migrate/20210702203400_create_relationship_between_captain_and_starship.rb
class CreateRelationshipBetweenCaptainsAndStarship < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_reference :captains, :starship, foreign_key: true, null: true
    # the line above does the following:
    #
    # * captains.starship_id with type bigint (the default type so we don't have to specify it)
    # * Allows captains.starship_id to be NULL (we need this because the relationship is optional)
    # * creates an index on captains.starship_id but it does not enforce uniqueness i.e. index is for performance
    # * create a foreign key constraint on captains.starship_id to reference starships.id. This is not the default but should be i think
  end
end
```

Pros/cons

* ++ Rails + SQL implements this just fine
* ++ Implemented by the Rails layers, enforced (not that there is much to enforce) at the SQL layer

### 5. {1} to {1}

Rarely used
Requires you to
    create both records at the same time (otherwise you have a chicken & egg problem)
    delete both records at same time
    updates are normal
You could do it with deferred constraints and/or triggers


rails layer
    aaa
        has_one :bbb
    bbb
        belongs_to :aaa
db layer
    on the bbb.aaa_id col (the foreign key col)
        make sure foreign key constraint set (should always be set)
        set NOT NULL (this ensures that bbb alwasy has one aaa)
        set unique index (this forces each bbb to have a different aaa)
            not strictly part of a 1 to 1 or is it?
    caveats
        how can i force aaa to always have a bbb at the DB level?
            I don't think it can be done at the DB level without something like a trigger?

### 6. {1..N} to {1}
### 7. {0..N} to {1}
### 8. {1..N} to {1..N}
### 9. {0..N} to {1..N}
### 10. {0..N} to {0..N}

#### Using habtm

    This is WIP

Summary of changes by layer:

* Relationship macro layer
* Validation layer
* Migration layer

    NOTE: habtm has no dependent option

Pros/cons

* -- You cannot set a `dependent` attribute on the HABTM macro
    * ??? what are implications of this?
* -- Possible loss of future flexibility
    * The migration doesn't create a unique id column for the join table so you'll need to add that in (and retrofit data values into it) if you later want to convert it to a `has_many(through: ...)`
    * You might actually want to turn the join into a real model in future which would be annoying work

Example:

```ruby
# app/models/captain.rb
class Captain < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :starships,
    inverse_of: :captains,
end

# app/models/starship.rb
class Starship < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :captains,
    inverse_of: :starships,
end

# app/models/captain_starship.rb
class CaptainStarship < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :captains,
    inverse_of: :starships,
end

# db/migrate/20210702203400_create_relationship_between_captain_and_starship.rb
class CreateRelationshipBetweenCaptainsAndStarship < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_join_table(:captains, :starships, column_options: { foreign_key: true, null: false }) do |t|
      t.index [:captain_id, :starship_id]
      t.index [:starship_id, :captain_id]
    end
    # After:
    # trek_development=# \d captains_starships
    #            Table "public.captains_starships"
    #    Column    |  Type  | Collation | Nullable | Default
    # -------------+--------+-----------+----------+---------
    #  captain_id  | bigint |           | not null |
    #  starship_id | bigint |           | not null |
    # Indexes:
    #     "index_captains_starships_on_captain_id_and_starship_id" btree (captain_id, starship_id)
    #     "index_captains_starships_on_starship_id_and_captain_id" btree (starship_id, captain_id)
    # Foreign-key constraints:
    #     "fk_rails_0925827edf" FOREIGN KEY (starship_id) REFERENCES starships(id)
    #     "fk_rails_764b7a3fdf" FOREIGN KEY (captain_id) REFERENCES captains(id)

  end
end
```

#### Using has_many through:

    This is WIP

Summary of changes by layer:

* Relationship macro layer
* Validation layer
* Migration layer

Example:

```ruby
# app/models/captain.rb
class Captain < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :postings, inverse_of: :captain
  has_many :starships, through: :postings
  # TODO: how to set inverse of?
end

# app/models/starship.rb
class Starship < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :postings, inverse_of: :captain
  has_many :starships, through: :posting
  # TODO: how to set inverse of?
end

# app/models/posting.rb
class Posting < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :captain, inverse_of: :postings
  belongs_to :starship, inverse_of: :postings
end

# db/migrate/20210702203400_create_relationship_between_captain_and_starship.rb
class CreateRelationshipBetweenCaptainsAndStarship < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :postings do |t|
      # use the singular name not the plural table name as first arg to belongs_To
      t.belongs_to :captain, foreign_key: true, null: false
      t.belongs_to :starship, foreign_key: true, null: false
      t.index [:captain_id, :starship_id]
      t.index [:starship_id, :captain_id]
    end
  end
end
```

Pros/cons

* -- bit more wordy than HABTM
* ++ you can specify a dependent option
* ++ more flexible for the future if you want to grow the jion model into a real model
